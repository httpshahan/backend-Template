# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Security Commitment

We take the security of the Node.js Backend Template seriously. This document outlines our security practices and how to report vulnerabilities.

## 📋 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Yes    |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No     |

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

### Preferred Method: GitHub Security Advisory

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/httpshahan/nodejs-backend-template/security) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the private vulnerability report form
4. Submit the report

### Alternative: Email

If you prefer email or GitHub Security Advisory is not available:

- **Email**: Create an issue and mention it's security-related (we'll move it to private discussion)
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Brief description of the vulnerability`

### What to Include

Please include as much of the following information as possible:

**Vulnerability Details:**

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- Location of the vulnerable code (file and line number if possible)
- Description of the potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability

**Environment Information:**

- Node.js version
- Operating system
- Database version (if applicable)
- Any relevant configuration details

**Proof of Concept:**

- Code snippets demonstrating the vulnerability
- Screenshots or logs if applicable
- Any exploit code (in a safe, non-harmful context)

## ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours of report
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity (see below)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

### Severity Levels

**Critical (24-48 hours)**

- Remote code execution
- SQL injection
- Authentication bypass
- Data exposure of sensitive information

**High (1 week)**

- Privilege escalation
- Significant data exposure
- Security feature bypass

**Medium (2-4 weeks)**

- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)

**Low (Next major release)**

- Security improvements
- Hardening recommendations
- Non-exploitable information disclosure

## 🔐 Security Measures in Place

### Automated Security Testing

- **GitHub Actions Security Workflow**: Runs comprehensive security tests on every push and PR
- **Daily Security Scans**: Automated daily dependency audits and vulnerability checks
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Weekly advanced security analysis for code vulnerabilities
- **Secrets Detection**: Automated scanning for exposed secrets and credentials
- **Container Security**: Docker image vulnerability scanning (if using containers)

### Code Security

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated using Joi and express-validator
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Sequelize ORM with parameterized queries
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with appropriate salt rounds
- **Rate Limiting**: Express rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **CORS Protection**: Configurable CORS settings
- **Security Headers**: Helmet middleware for security headers

### Development Security

- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated dependency vulnerability checking
- **Code Quality**: ESLint rules including security-focused rules
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite including security test cases
- **Documentation**: Security best practices documented
- **Local Security Testing**: Cross-platform security testing script

### Infrastructure Security

- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management
- **Secrets Management**: Proper handling of sensitive configuration
- **HTTPS**: SSL/TLS encryption for production deployments
- **Database Security**: Secure database connection practices

## 🚀 Security Best Practices for Users

### Development Environment

```bash
# Keep dependencies updated
npm audit
npm audit fix

# Use secure configuration
npm run setup:config  # Generates secure defaults

# Run comprehensive security testing
npm run security      # Run all security tests locally

# Individual security checks
npm run security:audit  # Run npm audit
npm run security:scan   # Run ESLint security scan
npm run security:deps   # Check dependencies

# Enable all security middleware
# (Already configured in the template)
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Set NODE_ENV to production
NODE_ENV=production

# Use strong JWT secrets (auto-generated by setup script)
# Use HTTPS in production
# Keep database credentials secure
# Regular security updates
```

### Configuration Security

- Never commit sensitive data to version control
- Use environment-specific configuration files
- Rotate JWT secrets regularly
- Use strong database passwords
- Enable database SSL in production

## 🔍 Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT token-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Token expiration and refresh mechanism

### Input Validation & Sanitization

- Request validation with Joi schemas
- Express-validator for route-level validation
- SQL injection prevention via ORM
- XSS prevention through proper output encoding

### Security Middleware

- Helmet for security headers
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- Request logging with Morgan
- Compression with security considerations

## 🏆 Security Hall of Fame

We recognize security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:

_No vulnerabilities reported yet - be the first to help us improve security!_

## 📞 Contact

For non-security related questions:

- GitHub Issues: General questions and feature requests
- GitHub Discussions: Community discussions

For security-related concerns:

- GitHub Security Advisory: Preferred method for vulnerability reports
- Repository Issues: Mark as security-related for private discussion

## 🤝 Coordinated Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Report**: Security issues are reported privately
2. **Assessment**: We assess the vulnerability and develop a fix
3. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a security patch
4. **Release**: We release the fix in a new version
5. **Public Disclosure**: After users have time to update, we publicly disclose the issue
6. **Recognition**: We credit the reporter (if they wish to be credited)

## 📄 Legal

By reporting a vulnerability, you agree to:

- Allow us reasonable time to investigate and fix the issue
- Not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we've had a chance to address it
- Not use the vulnerability for malicious purposes
- Act in good faith to avoid privacy violations and disruption to others

We commit to:

- Respond to your report in a timely manner
- Keep you informed about our progress
- Credit you for the discovery (if you wish)
- Not take legal action against you for good faith security research
